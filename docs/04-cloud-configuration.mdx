## XC (UI)

Use the web interface to configure the **Cloud** side, based on
the [L3/L4 Routed DDoS Mitigation](https://docs.cloud.f5.com/docs-v2/ddos-and-transit-services/how-tos/network-firewall/l3l4-ddos-mitigation) guide.

### Enable DDoS workspace

Before you can configure tunnels and BGP:

1. Contact the Cloud team (via `sales@example.com`
   or your account team) to:
    - Enable **Routed DDoS Mitigation** workspace for your tenant.
    - Provide:
        - Your **public IP netblocks** (/24 or shorter for IPv4, /48 or
          shorter for IPv6) and proof of ownership (or LOA).
        - Your **ASN** (must be issued by ARIN or equivalent registry).
        - **IRR** registration (RIPE, ARIN, APNIC, etc.) and **ROA** in
          RPKI repository.
        - Desired **clean-traffic return method** (GRE tunnels, Layer 2,
          private peering via Equinix, etc.).
        - Data center locations and routers to protect.
        - **AS-Path prepends** required for route announcements.
        - Any **BGP communities**, route preferences, or **AS-SET**

1. SOC will provision:
    - Tunnels
    - ASNs
    - Protected prefixes
    - Route advertisement options
    - Fast ACLs / firewall policies, as needed

### Tunnels

1. Log in to the [Cloud Console](https://docs.cloud.f5.com/docs-v2/ddos-and-transit-services/how-tos/network-firewall/l3l4-ddos-mitigation) and
   select **Routed DDoS** from the service selector.
1. Go to **Manage > Tunnels > Add Tunnel**, and configure:
    - **Location Name** and **Availability Zone** (Zone 1 by default).
    - **Bandwidth Max in MB**.
    - **Tunnel Type**:
        - **GRE Over IPv4** for IPv4 outer tunnel.
        - **GRE Over IPv6** for IPv6 outer tunnel.
        - **IP Over IP** for IPv4-in-IPv4 encapsulation.
        - **IPv6 Over IPv6** for IPv6-in-IPv6 encapsulation.
    - **Customer Endpoint IP**: BIG-IP's external address (outer self
      IP, must be publicly routable when tunnels traverse the public
      Internet).
    - Optional: IPv4/IPv6 interconnect, fragmentation, keepalive (all
      disabled by default).
1. Under **Tunnel BGP Information**:
    - Select an **ASN object** (your ASN).
    - Set **Customer Peer Secret Override**: Use Default Secret
      (default), BGP Password Override (blindfolded or clear text), or
      No Secret.
    - Set **Holddown Timer** value in seconds if different from
      default.

SOC may pre-create these tunnel objects for you; you simply match
the **endpoint IPs** and BGP settings on BIG-IP.

### ASNs and Routes

- **ASNs**: -> **Manage > ASNs > Add ASN**.
    - Enter your ASN and ensure BGP is enabled.

- **Prefixes**: -> **Manage > Prefixes > Add Prefix**.
    - Enter each IP prefix and associate it with your ASN.

- **Route Advertisements** -> **Manage > Route Advertisement > Add Route Advertisement**.
    - Enter prefix, choose **Active** or **Not Advertised**, and
      optional expiration.

These objects control which prefixes are announced via the global
network when the service is active.

### Network Restriction

**Firewall Rules**, **Deny List Rules**, and **Fast ACLs for Internet
VIPs** let you:

- Block or allow specific traffic.
- Rate-limit abusive sources.
- Apply additional DDoS protections beyond pure volumetric scrubbing.
