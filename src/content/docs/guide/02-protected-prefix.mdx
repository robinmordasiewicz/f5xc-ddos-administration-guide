## Protected prefix (public IP)

The **protected prefix** is your organization's public IP address block that
F5 Distributed Cloud defends against DDoS attacks.

| Requirement | IPv4 | IPv6 |
|-------------|------|------|
| **Minimum size** | /24 (256 IPs) | /48 |
| **Routability** | Publicly routable (non-RFC 1918) | Global unicast (non-ULA) |
| **Registration** | RIR-assigned (ARIN, RIPE, APNIC) | RIR-assigned |
| **Proof** | LOA or IRR/ROA registration | LOA or IRR/ROA registration |

**Traffic flow:**

1. F5 Distributed Cloud announces your prefix globally via BGP anycast
1. All Internet traffic destined for your IPs routes through F5 scrubbing centers
1. Attack traffic is dropped; clean traffic is delivered via GRE tunnels
